## Planning Stage

### Target Audience
* User who have never brewed beer before and are interested in trying it for the first time.
* Users who have brewed beer before or who are experienced brewers who want to learn additional tips to the brewing process.
* Users who want to learn about the process of brewing beer at home.
* Users who want to explore the product market for homebrew beer kits.
* Users who want to contact an organisation with questions regarding homebrewing beer.

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate quickly and easily through the page to find what I require.
* As a user, I want to leave the website more knowledgable than before visiting the site and be satisfied with my overall experience.
* As a user, I want to easily access additional resources for further personal research.
* As a user, I want to connect with the organisation, have the ability to ask questions and to stay up to date with company news. 

### Colour Scheme
* The site's main colours of black, white and gold were chosen to mimic the golden colours in a pint of lager within the dim setting of a pub.
* A colour grid was created to evaluate appropriate colour pairings using the [Eight Shapes Color Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23ffffff%0D%0A%23000000%0D%0A%23daa520%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp)
* From this it was decided that all fonts would be kept black upon either white or golden background colours in order to provide sufficient contrast for the users. The inversion was also used to highlight active classes or upon hovering over elements.

## Features

### Navigation
* The navigation bar shows the three main pages of the website which assist the user with smoot navigation. The header is consistent throughout all pages and is fixed to the top of the screen, meaning users can navigate to different pages easily.
* The submenus in the Brew and Resources pages allow the user to skip to the section they desire to view without manually scrolling themselves.
* Throughout the website there are several anchor elements which redirect the user to relevant pages and sub-sections of the website. For example in the introduction, several pages and sections within the website are hyperlinked within the paragraph to quickly redirect the user. The the text is underlined upon hovering the cursor over the hyperlinks to indicate to the user that it is an active link.  
* There is also a 'Return To Top' button at the bottom of the page to save the user from scrolling back up to the top of the page.

### Introduction
* Users are welcomed to the site by an introduction to the Apprentice Brewing organisation and a small gallery of homebrew beer to encourage curiosity for the user to explore the site more.
![Introduction section](assets/images/readme/who-we-are.PNG)

### Contact Form
* The contact from enables users to contact us with any questions they may have about brewing or the organisation. They also have the option to join the mailing list to stay informed on company updates and recommendations.
* The background image of people laughing and enjoying a beer expresses the company's desire to connect with their user community and encourages the user to get in touch.  
![Contact Form](assets/images/readme/contact-form.PNG)

### Animations
* Hero Image Zoom
This is the first thing the user will see on the site as the image is animated to zoom in 10% upon loading the page.
* Submenu Pan
The submenus are designed with a background image of the carbonation bubbles within a beer. Upon loading the pages the image scrolls from the top of the image to the bottom, giving the impression that the bubbles are rising through the menu.

### Brewing Guide
* The Equipment section provides direct hyperlinks to each product. This allows the user to familiarise themselves with what product looks like, and with a recommendation of a cheap option for each product should they wish to buy them.

* Users can click on each retailer anchor block to be redirected to their respectivel websites. Each website opens in a new tab to keep the user's position on our website to easily return to the resources page later.

## Future Enhancements
Various additional features would bring a greater user experience to the website: 
* The addition of a dedicated 'Tips' webpage would enable brewers to build upon their base knowledge by learning concepts including how to improve their process in brewing, the taste of their beer, and how to experiment with new flavours.
* The addition of user feedback through comments sections would allow for continual site improvement and additional perspectives from fellow brewers.
* The addition of a user up/down-voting system on the recommended products would help users to make an informed decision on what to buy by considering the recommendations of the site users.

## Testing


**Implementation üè≠**: When i had set up the products fixtures and loaded into the database i could then view all saleable items in the store, i wanted to ensure all products loaded as expected and that item information was visable when selected.

Test üß™: To test this, I went through each item and loaded the products information page, then looked at changing the url to ensure each item was loading correctly

Result üèÜ: All products loaded as expected to the main store page, some items were missing their images but they were still selectable and loaded their page correctly. When amending the url all items again loaded as expected however if i tried to access an item id that didn't exist i was presented with a 404 page.

Verdict ‚úÖ: This test passed in it's basic form, amendments are required to the fixtures to ensure all the items images load correctly, also as the 404 page is the generic template provided with Django creating a custom page to handle these errors is desireable.

* All links and images on the website work correctly and all elements are responsive to screen size.
* All embedded videos play within the site when clicked and successfully redirect to the Youtube site when requested. 
* The website was tested across various browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
* The website was responsive across screen sizes between 320px and 1600px in width. Content readablility was optimised by altering the size and positioning of elements. The Developer Tools function was used to test this across Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge to verify the site was fully responsive across the specificed screen witdhs and across different browsers.

    * No errors were found when running the html code through the [official W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
