## Planning Stage
### Target Audience
* User who have never brewed beer before and are interested in trying it for the first time.
* Users who have brewed beer before or who are experienced brewers who want to learn additional tips to the brewing process.
* Users who want to learn about the process of brewing beer at home.
* Users who want to explore the product market for homebrew beer kits.
* Users who want to contact an organisation with questions regarding homebrewing beer.

### User Stories
* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate quickly and easily through the page to find what I require.
* As a user, I want to leave the website more knowledgable than before visiting the site and be satisfied with my overall experience.
* As a user, I want to easily access additional resources for further personal research.
* As a user, I want to connect with the organisation, have the ability to ask questions and to stay up to date with company news. 

### Colour Scheme
* The site's main colours of black, white and gold were chosen to mimic the golden colours in a pint of lager within the dim setting of a pub.
* A colour grid was created to evaluate appropriate colour pairings using the [Eight Shapes Color Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23ffffff%0D%0A%23000000%0D%0A%23daa520%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp)
* From this it was decided that all fonts would be kept black upon either white or golden background colours in order to provide sufficient contrast for the users. The inversion was also used to highlight active classes or upon hovering over elements.

## Features
### Navigation
* The navigation bar shows the three main pages of the website which assist the user with smoot navigation. The header is consistent throughout all pages and is fixed to the top of the screen, meaning users can navigate to different pages easily.
* The submenus in the Brew and Resources pages allow the user to skip to the section they desire to view without manually scrolling themselves.
* Throughout the website there are several anchor elements which redirect the user to relevant pages and sub-sections of the website. For example in the introduction, several pages and sections within the website are hyperlinked within the paragraph to quickly redirect the user. The the text is underlined upon hovering the cursor over the hyperlinks to indicate to the user that it is an active link.  
* There is also a 'Return To Top' button at the bottom of the page to save the user from scrolling back up to the top of the page.

### Introduction
* Users are welcomed to the site by an introduction to the Apprentice Brewing organisation and a small gallery of homebrew beer to encourage curiosity for the user to explore the site more.
![Introduction section](assets/images/readme/who-we-are.PNG)

### Contact Form
* The contact from enables users to contact us with any questions they may have about brewing or the organisation. They also have the option to join the mailing list to stay informed on company updates and recommendations.
* The background image of people laughing and enjoying a beer expresses the company's desire to connect with their user community and encourages the user to get in touch.  
![Contact Form](assets/images/readme/contact-form.PNG)

### Animations
* Hero Image Zoom
This is the first thing the user will see on the site as the image is animated to zoom in 10% upon loading the page.
* Submenu Pan
The submenus are designed with a background image of the carbonation bubbles within a beer. Upon loading the pages the image scrolls from the top of the image to the bottom, giving the impression that the bubbles are rising through the menu.

## Future Enhancements
Various additional features would bring a greater user experience to the website: 
* The addition of a dedicated 'Tips' webpage would enable brewers to build upon their base knowledge by learning concepts including how to improve their process in brewing, the taste of their beer, and how to experiment with new flavours.
* The addition of user feedback through comments sections would allow for continual site improvement and additional perspectives from fellow brewers.
* The addition of a user up/down-voting system on the recommended products would help users to make an informed decision on what to buy by considering the recommendations of the site users.

## Testing
* All links and images on the website work correctly and all elements are responsive to screen size.
* All embedded videos play within the site when clicked and successfully redirect to the Youtube site when requested. 
* The website was tested across various browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
* The website was responsive across screen sizes between 320px and 1600px in width. Content readablility was optimised by altering the size and positioning of elements. The Developer Tools function was used to test this across Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge to verify the site was fully responsive across the specificed screen witdhs and across different browsers.

### Bugs
* **Issue** - Centering images and headings within div elements
    * **Resolution** - Initially a supplementary empty div was placed about the image requiring centering to act as a spacer. However a much cleaner and simpler solution was employed by using  the transform:translate(50%, 50%) function alongside relative positioning. This enabled the element to be positioned relative to its center rather than the edges.
    * **Reference code*
* **Issue** - Fully containing floated elements within parent div elements
    * **Resolution** - A <br> element was created with class="clear" which assigned attributes of clear:both and line-height:0. This meant that any floats currently active were cancelled and the <br> element expanded the div element to fully contain all child elements.
    * **Reference code*
* **Issue** - Header blocking the section titles after clicking on submenu hyperlinks
    * **Resolution** - An additional buffer was added when redirecting to different section via scroll-padding-top: 6rem. This added 6rem on to the absolue position of the titles to accomodate with the height of the header.
    * **Reference code*
* **Issue** - Centering video 
    * **Resolution** - A class="video-contianer" was created, with hidden overflow and position set to relative. padding-bottom:56.25% was used to create an aspect ratio of 16:9 relative to the width. height:0 as the padding-bottom dictated the size of the container. Within this class, the iframe was selected and assigned absolute positioning, with width and height both 100% and aligned from the top-left edges. This created an iframe video which was centered within its container, which was also centered on the page.
    * **Reference code*
* **Issue** - Content moving onto next line on smaller screens
    * **Resolution** - Media queries were introduced depending on screen size to target elements for responsive deign. As the screen size reduced, the width of the content container was increased to fit in more content, the logo, menu items and footer icon font-size was reduced to fit on one line.

* **Issue** - Elements moving onto next line upon adding padding and margins
    * **Resolution** - The box-sizing: border box attribute was added which included padding and margins in the width of elements. This meant no compensation in width was required when assigning equal widths to elements. For example, this was used in the navbar menu, and submenus product link boxes.  

### Unfixed Bugs
There are no known bugs left unfixed.
